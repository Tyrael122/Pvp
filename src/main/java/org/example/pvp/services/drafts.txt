ranking service

- test if it can pair two matchGroups correctly when there are only two matchGroups, same level
- test if it can pair two matchGroups correctly when there are more than two matchGroups, same level
- test if it can pair two matchGroups correctly when there are more than two matchGroups, not in same level
- test if it doesnt pair two incompatible matchGroups
- test if it can pair two imcopatible matchGroups taking into account the time they have been waiting
- test if it ignores a matchmakingProfile that has already been queued
- test if it ignores a matchmakingProfile that has already been queued in a matchGroup
- test if it ignores a matchmakingProfile that has already been queued in a matchGroup that is already in a ready match
- test if it can remove a matchmakingProfile from the queue
- test if it can remove a matchmakingProfile from a formed matchGroup
- test if it can remove a matchmakingProfile from a ready match
- test if it can form multiple matches
match service:
- test if starts matches correctly
- test if ends matches correctly
- test if it can calculate the next match end time correctly

tests to make manually:


50
70
90
100 - md1
80

considerations to reflect upon:
should manual test interface be implemented? yes, send to him later.

should we try to make the loss and winning points not static, but based on the current ratings?
try to make elo rating dynamic, with premade formulas.
establish max or min points to be won or lost in a match.

obs/possibility:
streak bonus.
when losing or winning, start a losing or a winning streak, up to 10 points. increase 2 points in the streak for each win or loss.
10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 max percentage of the points to be won or lost.
if breaking a streak, zero the streak.

what happens in a draw?
everybody wins some points (no more, draw score is determined by elo system)

md1 to up division.
when getting to 90 points, round to 100 to up division in md1.
when losing, dont round.
