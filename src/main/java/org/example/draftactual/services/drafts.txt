tests to make manually:


50
70
90
100 - md1
80

considerations to reflect upon:
should manual test interface be implemented? yes, send to him later.

should we try to make the loss and winning points not static, but based on the current ratings?
try to make elo rating dynamic, with premade formulas.
establish max or min points to be won or lost in a match.

obs/possibility:
streak bonus.
when losing or winning, start a losing or a winning streak, up to 10 points. increase 2 points in the streak for each win or loss.
10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 max percentage of the points to be won or lost.
if breaking a streak, zero the streak.

what happens in a draw?
everybody wins some points (no more, draw score is determined by elo system)

md1 to up rank.
when getting to 90 points, round to 100 to up rank in md1.
when losing, dont round.
